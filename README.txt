This is a lightweight telematics pipeline MVP that simulates
vehicle telemetry, ingests it through a REST API,
and visualizes it through a dashboard.

This is intended to mirror how connected-operations
platforms (Samsara/Motive/Fleetio-adjacent) work
in real life:

Device/sensor -> API ingestion -> cloud/logic
-> dashboard

Demonstrating ability to:

-model telemetry
-build REST endpoints for ingestion
-validate and store time-series data
-visualize trends for non-technical users
-explain a technical system clearly

What's in the repo

-api.py (FastAPI app)
-emulator.py (telemetry generator)
-dashboard.py (Streamlit UI)
-JSON file (sample output)
-requirements.txt
-README.txt

Prerequisites
-Python 3.10 installed
-Terminal Access (Powershell/CMD)

 Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/sjr9d2cxnp-beep/obd-telemetry-emulator.git

Enter the directory:
cd obd-telemetry-emulator

-Create virtual environment in the directory:
    python -m venv venv

-Activate venv 
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

If it is blocked, run this ONCE as an admin in Powershell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicyRemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Activate again.

Install dependencies in that directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt


You will need 3 terminal windows to run this:

For each new window you will need to run these commands FIRST:
cd obd-telemetry-emulator
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


Terminal 1: Start api -> uvicorn api:app
Terminal 2: Run emulator -> python emulator.py
Terminal 3: Run the dashboard -> streamlit run dashboard.py

Verify its working by opening http://127.0.0.1:8000/telemetry

You should see a growing list of JSON telemetry points.

Once you run the streamlit command, it should take you to a browser window with the dashboard. 

Dashboard should show latest row + RPM line graph

Data is random demo data, so the RPM and corresponding graphs
will look chaotic. 

Refresh the page to get new 
data points.

Once you are done, close out the terminal windows. Next open a new one and run these commands:
cd..
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "C:\Users\YOURCOMPUTERUSER\obd-telemetry-emulator"

This will delete the cloned project from your computer.

If there are any errors, contact me at drake@drakewildes.co and I will fix them.

PLANNED:
-GitHub repo and Loom demo walkthrough
-Dashboard panels (Alerts, system status, etc)
-Alert Logic (overheat, high rpm, etc)
-Improve emulator behavior (smooth idle, city -> hwy transitions)
